# Face Detection App using Viola-Jones Algorithm

This is a Streamlit-based web application for detecting faces in images using the Viola-Jones algorithm. The app allows users to upload an image, adjust detection parameters, choose the color of bounding boxes, and save the processed image.

## Features

- Upload an image for face detection.
- Adjust `minNeighbors` and `scaleFactor` parameters for fine-tuning detection.
- Choose the color of the rectangles around detected faces.
- Save the processed image with detected faces to your device.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bettahar-mehdi/face-detection-app.git
   cd face-detection-app
